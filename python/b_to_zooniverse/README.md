#### Setup

The following files/directories are expected:

+ galaxy_catalog.fits
+ previous_galaxy_zoo_subjects.csv
+ fits (dir)
+ calibration_jpeg (dir)

The names of each can be set in the main file, upload_decals.py

If you've run the DECaLS download, you should already have a galaxy catalog, fits directory and jpeg directory.
